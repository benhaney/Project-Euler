This repo contains my various solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

These are primarily math challenges with the goal of getting the challenger to discover clever logic that can be used to solve the problems efficiently (at least in the case of later challenges).

However, I usually use these challenges to get familiar with the syntax of a new language, brush up on an old language, or compare the performance of two or more languages. As such, I make no promises about the cleverness of my solutions.
