## Problem 12
### Highly divisible triangular number

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

```
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
```

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

* 1:  1
* 3:  1,3
* 6:  1,2,3,6
* 10: 1,2,5,10
* 15: 1,3,5,15
* 21: 1,3,7,21
* 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
